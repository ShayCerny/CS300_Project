# Project Reflection - Data Structure Selection for Class Information
## Problem Statement
The goal of this project was to analyze and determine the best data structure to store class information, allowing for efficient retrieval in multiple ways. Specifically, the project focused on searching for a specific class, displaying them in alphanumerical order, and managing their loading process. After considering various options, I chose a binary search tree (BST) as the ideal data structure due to its efficiency in supporting ordered data and fast search operations.

## Approach to the Problem
I approached the problem methodically, taking it one step at a time. First, I focused on understanding the requirements for the system, which included the need for searching, sorting, and loading data. Understanding these requirements helped me realize that a BST would be well-suited for the task because of its logarithmic time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations in balanced trees. As I worked through the problem, I made sure to break down the tasks, which allowed me to clearly focus on one aspect of the data structure at a time—be it adding data, implementing the search algorithm, or ensuring that the data could be displayed in the desired order.

## Overcoming Roadblocks
Although I didn’t face any major roadblocks in the development of the project, there were a few challenges that required careful consideration. One challenge was ensuring that I handled edge cases correctly, like when the tree was empty or had only one element. To address this, I took a step back to review my logic and ensure that all potential situations were accounted for. This careful review helped me avoid errors and ensured that the program worked smoothly across different scenarios.

## Expansion of Software Design Approach
This project has significantly expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs. Before this, I typically focused more on functionality without paying close attention to how data was structured. Now, I realize the importance of selecting the right data structure to optimize performance and scalability. The process of analyzing different data structures and understanding their trade-offs helped me see the broader picture of system design and how crucial efficient data handling is for software to perform well, especially with larger datasets.

## Evolution in Writing Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Code
Working on this project has made me more aware of the importance of writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code. In implementing the binary search tree, I made sure to structure the code with clear naming conventions, concise methods, and adequate documentation. This not only helped me track my progress but also made it easier to identify and fix issues. Additionally, the experience taught me to write code that could be easily adapted to future requirements—whether I need to modify the way classes are stored or how data is retrieved. The experience has instilled in me the value of code readability and maintainability, knowing that software will often need updates or revisions in the future.

## Conclusion
This project has been a valuable learning experience in terms of both technical skill and software design. It highlighted the importance of understanding data structures in depth and their real-world applications. By reflecting on the challenges I faced and the solutions I implemented, I’ve gained deeper insights into how to design and build programs that are efficient, adaptable, and easy to maintain.
